Keysig is a base framework/example for doing keyboard keystroke pattern capture and unique signature creation/analysis in a cross-browser manner (i.e.) grade "A" browsers. This
type of functionality could have many real world implementations, but probably the most likely candidate would be a browser based biometric login system of some sort.

This goal for this project is simply to serve as a solid guide for how something like this might be achieved.  Keysig is not necessarily a stand-alone project, but more something that is to be learned from and/or potentially integrated into other systems (ex) biometric analysis.
